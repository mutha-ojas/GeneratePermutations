# GeneratePermutations
Two numbers, without leading zeros, are similar if rearranging the digits gives matching numbers, i.e., numbers with the equal frequency of each digit. 
For example, the numbers 1100 and 1001 are similar, but 1100 and 0110 are not similar because 0110 has a leading zero Given two strings that represent long integers a and b, 
check their similarity. Based on the finding, determine one of the following: 
• If a and b are similar, find the total number of similar numbers to a.
• If a and b are not similar, find the total number of similar numbers to b. 
• Example 
  • if a = 112 and b = 121, they are similar. Count the 3 numbers similar to a: {112, 121, 211}. 
  • If a = 11 and b = 223, they are not similar. Count the 3 numbers similar to b: {223, 232, 322}.
